      the home buying process easier and more efficient. As a broker, he has found
      a passion for helping his clients save as much money as possible and connecting

      loves working with clients interested in purchasing another home or investment
      properties. He embodies the Spartan ethos of preparedness, experience, and is
      ready to do what is necessary for his clients. \n\nEric knows what is on the
      line for his clients and is ready to compete and succeed in a competitive housing
      market.\n\nSecond time home buying or expanding in investment properties is
      a milestone that Eric is honored to be a part of. For those clients who are
