      Eric has spent the last two decades helping Californians attack their home buying and financial goals. He started Spartan Funding to help make the home buying process easier and more efficient. As a broker, he has found a passion for helping his clients save as much money as possible and connecting them to loan options and incentive programs that fit their financial goals.
      
      Eric loves working with clients interested in purchasing another home or investment properties. He embodies the Spartan ethos of preparedness, experience, and is ready to do what is necessary for his clients. Eric knows that is on the line for his clients and is ready to compete and succeed in a competitive housing market. Second time home buying or expanding in investment properties is a milestone that Eric is honored to be a part of. For those clients who are Spartan, the FastTrack technology will expedite the approval process and ensure that the property of your dreams can be yours.
